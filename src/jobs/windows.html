<p>Flutter is the most popular multi-platform UI toolkit, with shipped support
  for iOS and Android. We’re currently expanding our support for Windows so we
  can target an additional 1B users and offer a better alternative to desktop
  developers who use Electron, Windows Forms, WPF, or (shudder) UWP!</p>

<p>The Flutter Desktop Team is responsible for the desktop-specific (Windows,
  MacOS, Linux) embeddings of the Flutter engine, which includes enabling
  platform plugins, nesting platform views inside Flutter apps, and wiring-up
  accessibility hooks on those platforms – and anything else that helps Flutter
  feel “native” when run in those environments.</p>

<p>In the "Windows Engineer" role you'll be part of the team that makes Flutter
  apps the absolute best they can be when running on Windows, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Designing and building multi-window support.</li>
  <li>Building support for Windows system menu integration.</li>
  <li>Adding support for shell / window drag ‘n drop.</li>
  <li>Adding support for nesting Windows UI views inside Flutter apps.</li>
  <li>Delivering outstanding performance on Windows.</li>
  <li>Nurturing a thriving community of contributions from open-source
    developers by reviewing GitHub issues and pull requests (PRs).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Job responsibilities</h2>

  <li>Minimize the memory and file-size footprint required by Flutter Windows
