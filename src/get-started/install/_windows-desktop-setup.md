## Windows setup

{{site.alert.warning}}
  **Beta (Win32) and Alpha (UWP)!**
  This area covers Windows desktop support,
  which is available in beta release (Win32)
  and alpha release (UWP). The UWP variant is 
  community supported.

  You can try a beta snapshot of Win32 desktop support
  on the stable channel, or you can keep up
  with the latest changes to desktop on the
  `beta` channel. For Windows UWP you need
  to be on the `master` channel.

  For more information, see the **Desktop**
  section in [What's new in Flutter 2.2][],

### Additional Windows requirements

For Windows desktop development,
you need the following in addition to the Flutter SDK:

* [Visual Studio 2022][] for Flutter 2.9 beta and newer,
  [Visual Studio 2019][] for Flutter 2.8.1 and older.
  Note, Visual Studio is different to Visual Studio _Code_.
  For Win32 you need the "Desktop development with C++" 
  workload installed, including all of its default components. 
  For UWP you need the "Universal Windows Platform development"
  workload installed, with the optional UWP C++ tools.
